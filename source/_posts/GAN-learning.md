# What is GAN?

_GAN_ is the abbreviation of _Generative Adversarial Network_.It is a model of __structure learning__

# Why do I learn GAN?

GAN caught my attention when I read a paper about designing drugs causing desired transciptome change by _Bidirectional Adversarial Autoencoder(BiAA)_.Then I became interesting in the base the BiAA built upon,which is _GAN_ and _Autoencoder_.

_cited from doi:10.3389/fphar.2020.00269_
> Gene expression profiles are useful for assessing the efficacy and side effects of drugs. In this paper, we propose a new generative model that infers drug molecules that could induce a desired change in gene expression.

Here are the reason why I want to study further and deeper about this model

* The model's structure is interesting which contains a generator and a discriminator that help with each other. 
* It is becoming more and more popular at a crazy speed.(Though many variations of it exist,it seems that no huge breakthough is made.)
* It may help with the exploration of a brand new way of drug design.
* The teacher Hongyi Li is so interesting.

# Things I want to learn about GAN

* how it works by mathematic
* the already-realized and promising application of it
* how to use it in the field of medicine and how to make it more useful and dependable

# Things I need to do

* Learning the online courses by Hongyi Li
* Read and try to understand the source code of [BiAA](https://github.com/insilicomedicine/BiAAE.git)
* Add BiAA to my software or come up with a better model
