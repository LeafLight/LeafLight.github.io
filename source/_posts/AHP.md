## What is APH

It is a method to make a decision in depends of only subjective information.

It is based on mathematics and psycology.

## Why APH

It avoids incomprehensive consideration by paired comparison.

## How to do APH

It is easy to do an APH.

### General Workflow

1. Build the hierarchy.
2. Do $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ times of paired comparisons to fill a decision matrix of the first hierarchy with respect to the object hierarchy.
3. Get the weight array by normalize the feature vector of the matrix.
4. Get the weight of the consequent hierarchy in the same way.
5. Calculate the result by the weights.

### Notes

Remember to check the decision matrix.
